# Trulia-Web-Scraper
Source US Property/MLS data from Trulia; a website that is no stranger to data mining deterrents.  This project demonstrates how a polymorphic web scraper can evade bot detection while asynchronously extracting data. 
### NOTE
This project is a proof of concept to demonstrate weakness in bot detection when faced with an advanced webscraper.  It is not designed with malicious intent, nor do I promote the use of this scraper to be used irresposnably.
